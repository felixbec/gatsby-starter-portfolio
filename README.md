  Gatsby Starter Portfolio
</h1>

## üöÄ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the gatsby-starter-portfolio starter.

    ```shell
    # create a new Gatsby site using the gatsby-starter-portfolio
    gatsby new gatsby-starter-portfolio https://github.com/felixbec/gatsby-starter-portfolio
    ```

2.  **Before starting to develop.**

    Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory, install dependencies and start it up.

    ```shell
    cd gatsby-starter-portfolio/
    npm install
    npm start
    ```

    At this point you have the repository download with all the dependencies installed, but if you try to start by running `npm start` you are going to receive these messages in the console:
    ```
    Unable to locate env file at location (.env.development)
    ```

    ```
    Accessing your Contentful space failed.
    Try setting GATSBY_CONTENTFUL_OFFLINE=true to see if we can serve from cache.

    Endpoint not found. Check if host and spaceId settings are correct
    ```

    Due to Contentful space not being setup, the portfolio will take the information. So the next step is create an empty space in [Contentful!](https://www.contentful.com/)

3.  **Configure Contentful.**

    Begin by creating an empty space in [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), then run the following command `npm run setup`. The CLI popup will request the following values:
    
    ```shell
        Space ID
        Content Delivery API Access Token
        Content Management Person Access Token
    ```
    _Note: This is required in order to import the demo's Content Model and placeholder data._

    Upon successful import, you should receive a message in the terminal: 
    The import was successful.
    All set! You can now run `npm start` to see it in action.
    
    _Note: The `npm run setup` script will generate a `env.development` file with the provided API Access Tokens._

    _Note: Gatsby Starter Portfolio requires an `.env.production` for production build. Make sure you create a copy of `.env.development` and rename to `.env.production`. This allows users to have a Development Contentful Space and a Production Contentful Space._

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `https://localhost:3000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`https://localhost:3000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `gatsby-starter-portfolio` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

## ü§ò Theming

    Now the fun part! With this starter, the colors are customizeable. 

    Inside the `src/Theme.js`, there are 2 themes, Light Mode and Dark Mode. 
    All the colors and font size in the starter are driven from this file.

    `src/SiteConfig.js` - Allows you to change the content that is not configured in [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/).

## üßê What's inside?

    A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .prettierrc
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-browser.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-node.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierignore`**: This file tells prettier which files it should ignore.

5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby browser APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting the browser.

7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.

9.  **`LICENSE`**: Gatsby is licensed under the MIT license.

10.  **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project‚Äôs name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
